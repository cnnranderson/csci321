\subsection{Gatherers}

To get a handle on state machines, and how they can be used
in games to make NPC's more lifelike, consider a simple
resources game.  In this game, there is no player interaction,
however, there are three NPCs that interact with each other:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gatherers
\item Goodies
\item Enemies
\end{itemize}
The Gatherers gather goodies and move them to the center of the
screen.  The Enemies try to steal the goodies.  When they spot an
Enemy, gatherers try to kill it.  A screenshot of the game is shown in
Figure \ref{Gatherers}.  Here the small blue triangles are the
gatherers, the red stars are the goodies, and the large black
triangles are the enemies.  The crosses are the dead enemies.
