\centerline{\bf CSCI 321, 3D Game Specs, Winter 2013}

{\bf Due date: Friday, February 22, 10:00am}

Reread the general game specifications for general things I'll look for in
your game.  However, since 3D is generally {\em much} harder than 2D,
much less is expected of your game.  Splash screens, scoreboards,
health bars, and most of the other non-diegetic material does not have
to be implemented.  One interesting level is plenty.  

If you've used images, sounds, or other resources, make sure you pack
them into your blend file with the
\verb+File->External Data->Pack into .blend file+ menu item.

Set up a new screen layout, called {\bf PlayGame}, by pressing the
$+$-key on the drop-down menu that has the builtin screen layouts
(Default, Animation, {\em etc.}), renaming it, and then setting it up
with just one large 3D window on the left, and a narrow text window on
the right, as in this figure:

Set up the 3D window so it is ready to play with a single press of the
P-key:  textured mode, camera view, {\em etc.}
You can provide the name, in-game help, {\em etc.} in the text window,
so that the manual does not have to be consulted.  

Also produce a user's manual, as before, nicely formatted.
Please let me know here all the special features
and glorious whatnots you put in your game; tell me what you spent
your time on, so I won't miss it when I'm deciding your grade.
A programmer's guide is not necessary unless you wrote a lot of code
for your game.
