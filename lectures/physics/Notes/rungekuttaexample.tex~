Here's a rewrite of the stuff I did in class on Tuesday.

Suppose we have a point moving in space, and the coordinates of the
point are given by $p(t)$.  For a one-dimensional spring, the
coordinates we're interested in are position, velocity, and
acceleration, or 
\[p(t) = (x(t), v(t), a(t))\]  For our simple spring,
the acceleration
