{\sf  \em
The truths contained in religious doctrines are after all so distorted
and systematically disguised that the mass of humanity cannot
recognize them as truth.  The case is similar to what happens when we
tell a child that new-born babies are brought by the stork.  Here,
too, we are telling the truth in symbolic clothing, for we know what
the large bird signifies.

\ns{Ordinary World}

OWEN: You must understand I need you here, Luke.
\bigskip

LUKE: But it's a whole 'nother year.
\bigskip

OWEN: Look, it's only one more season.
\bigskip


LUKE: Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.
\bigskip

AUNT BERU: Where are you going?
\bigskip

LUKE: It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those
droids.

\ns{Call to Adventure}

LEIA: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan
Kenobi. You're my only hope.
\bigskip

THREEPIO: Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old
data. Pay it no mind.
\bigskip


LUKE: Who is she? She's beautiful.



\ns{Meeting with the Mentor}


LUKE: What happened?

\bs

BEN: Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're
still in one piece.

\bs

LUKE: Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! 

\bs

BEN: The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young
Luke, what brings you out this far?


\ns{Refusal of the Call}

\bs

LUKE: I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like
the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right
now. It's such a long way from here.

\bs

BEN: That's your uncle talking.



\ns{Crossing the First Threshold}
{\small

TROOPER: Let me see your identification.

\ms

BEN: You don't need to see his identification.

\ms

TROOPER: We don't need to see his identification.

\ms

BEN: These are not the droids your looking for.

\ms

TROOPER: These are not the droids we're looking for.

\ms

BEN: He can go about his business.

\ms

TROOPER: You can go about your business.

\ms

BEN: (to Luke) Move along.

\ms

TROOPER: Move along. Move along.
}

\ns{Tests, Allies, Enemies}

\bs

BEN: This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our
needs.

...

\bs

HAN: It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve
parsecs!

...

\bs


LEIA: Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding
Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on
board.



\ns{Approach to the Inmost Cave}

LUKE: Look at him. He's headed for that small moon.

\bs

HAN: I think I can get him before he gets there...he's almost in
range.

\bs

BEN: That's no moon! It's a space station.

\bs

HAN: It's too big to be a space station.

\bs

LUKE: I have a very bad feeling about this.

\ns{Ordeal}

HAN: (sarcastically) Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful
idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! 

...

\bs

LUKE: There's something alive in here!

\bs

HAN: That's your imagination.

\bs

LUKE: Something just moved past my leg! Look! Did you see that?

\bs

HAN: What?

\bs

LUKE: Help!



\ns{Reward}

\bs

BEN'S VOICE: Run, Luke! Run!



\ns{The Road Back}


DODONNA: Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is
ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

\bs

WEDGE: That's impossible, even for a computer.

\bs

LUKE: It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my
T-sixteen back home. They're not much bigger than two meters.

\ns{Resurrection}


BEN'S VOICE: Use the Force, Luke.

...
\bs

INTERIOR: DARTH VADER'S COCKPIT.

\bs

VADER: I have you now.

\bs

           He pushes the fire buttons.

\bs

VADER: What?

\bs


INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT.

\bs

HAN: (yelling) Yahoo!



\ns{Return with the Elixir}


INTERIOR: MASSASSI OUTPOST -- MAIN HANGAR.

\bs

Luke climbs out of his starship fighter and is cheered by a
throng of ground crew and pilots. Luke climbs down the ladder
as they all welcome him with laughter, cheers, and shouting.
Princess Leia rushes toward him.

\bs

LEIA: Luke! Luke! Luke!
