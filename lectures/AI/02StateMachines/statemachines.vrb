\li FSMs a good way to manage complex behavior.
\li Can use two FSMs in parallel, {\em e.g.}:
  \bi
  \li One for movement
  \li One for weapon selection, aiming, firing
  \ei
\li Can use hierarchical FSMs:
 one state machine inside the state of another, {\em e.g.}:
  \bi
  \li High level states:  {\bf Explore}, {\bf Combat}, {\bf Patrol}
  \li Low level states inside Combat:
  \bi \li Dodge \li ChaseEnemy \li Shoot \ei
